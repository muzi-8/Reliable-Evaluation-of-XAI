# Reliable-Evaluation-of-XAI
This repository is the official implementation and is a benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of model saliency/attention map explanations from  existing interpretability technique.
This repository contains the code, pre-trained model, constructed evaluation data set and ground truth by human annotation. We propose a unified evaluation framework for the 
three dimensions of accuracy, persuasibility and class-discriminativeness.
